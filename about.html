                Abhiyaan is a cultural extravaganza which features events ranging
                from literary skills to performing arts to stardom and glamour. Our
                five day event is the highlight to the town which attracts the
                attention of many different college students and team of performers.
                Every year we feature participation from students from prominent
                colleges in Navi Mumbai. This year Abhiyaan is all about the
                nostalgia we have witnessed in our school day, from pen fights to
                book cricket, from scribbling on your friend's book to passing
                secret messages in them, from lousy mornings assemblies to tirey
                last periods, we do miss our school days more often than not.
                However, the flashbacks are many a times followed with a feeling of
                sadness. Let's change that, shall we? Back To School, like those
                commercial for backpacks, is the time for a happy nostalgia for the
                adults just out of teenage. Reminiscing in the events complied with
                fun activities are what we might just need to get back to the good
                old days.
