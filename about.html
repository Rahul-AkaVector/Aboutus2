                    Abhiyaan is Bharati Vidyapeeth College of Engineering’s Annual fest.
                    Which is held in the month of February-March. We are non-profit
                    volunteers whose main aim is to provide opportunities to the young
                    talents of various colleges and to provide a positive message to the
                    society.
                    The funfilled event will be of 9-10 days consisting of all type of
                    technical, sports, cultural and inter college events. There are three
                    Cultural Days. Sports events are going to be held in a span of 4-5 days
                    followed by our cultural event which is held in a span of next 2-3 days.
                    Most importantly the event not only includes students from our
                    campus (which includes Architecture, Engineering, Nursing, dental and
                    diploma colleges) but also the students from near by colleges. So you
                    can expect a foot fall of atleast 2000 to 2500 students.
